## Version Control -> Working Folder

> pwd: print working directory (Display current path of the directory) [Output '/Users/...(foldername)' ]

> mkdir {+ an argument(new_folder_name)}: make directory (Create directory/New Folder with a given name) [No output]

$$\text{Error when creating the same file twice -> mkdir: created-using-the-command-line: File exists}$$

> ls: list (Display all files in current directory)

> ls -A: list Flag All (Display all files including "." files which are hidden)

> cd {+ an argument(folder_name)}: change directory (Navigates to subdirectory under current directory)

> cd ..: back to parent directory (yeah two dots)
